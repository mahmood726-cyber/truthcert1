## Abstract
**Background:** Pairwise evidence synthesis projects need reliable import pathways and structured interpretation modules to support both scientific reporting and HTA framing. TruthCert-PairwisePro v1.0 addresses this by combining analysis and reporting in one browser tool.

**Methods:** The application is delivered as a standalone HTML bundle with client-side plotting and export libraries. The interface supports RevMan, Covidence, CSV, TSV, and JSON import; run and full-analysis controls; forest and contribution views; bias and HTA interpretation modules; and report export. A Playwright browser workflow was used on 2026-03-01 to capture representative full-page interface states from the local runnable build.

**Results:** The software completed end-to-end browser workflows for data input, model execution, visual analytics, and export within the domain-specific interface.

**Conclusions:** TruthCert-PairwisePro v1.0 provides a practical browser-native workflow for evidence synthesis; final submission readiness depends on attaching a public repository link and DOI-archived release metadata.

## Introduction
Pairwise evidence synthesis tools are most useful when they combine methodological transparency with practical decision-facing outputs. Without clear validation context, interpretive confidence can be overstated.

TruthCert PairwisePro is presented as an integrated browser workflow with explicit reporting of where agreement is strong and where advanced estimators show residual differences. This manuscript keeps claims aligned with documented evidence to support fair peer review.

### Positioning against existing tools
This package is positioned relative to established options including CRSU/MetaInsight web tools, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA), Stata-based workflows, and package-driven R pipelines. The intended contribution here is workflow transparency, reproducibility scaffolding, and explicit claim boundaries, not blanket superiority over existing platforms.

### Table 1. Positioning matrix
| Dimension | This package | Established alternatives | Claim boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Transparent, reproducible end-to-end workflow | Mature GUIs/statistical packages with broad legacy adoption | Scope limited to demonstrated workflows |
| User profile | Clinicians/researchers needing guided reproducibility | Advanced analysts and mixed-skill teams | Complementary use is recommended |
| Strength emphasis | Auditability, artifact linkage, structured outputs | Feature breadth and ecosystem maturity | Interpret strengths relative to use case |
| Reproducibility support | Walkthrough + validation summary + checklist | Varies by tool/package and setup | Claims remain artifact-bounded |

## Methods
### Implementation
The software is delivered as a standalone HTML bundle with client-side modules for multi-format import, pairwise estimation, visual outputs, and reporting. Evidence-processing and interpretation tabs are connected through a unified state model so analysts can rerun and compare outputs under stable settings.

### Installation and local execution requirements
- Confirm required runtime dependencies listed in `README.md` and project environment files.
- Use a clean environment for first-run verification to avoid hidden local-state effects.
- Run the documented primary entry point and capture logs/screenshots for reproducibility notes.
- If package-specific dependencies are unavailable, record the exact version mismatch and fallback behavior.

### Operation
- Open `Main screen.html` and import demonstration or user datasets from supported formats.
- Configure pairwise model settings and execute run/full-run workflows.
- Review forest/contribution/bias/HTA panels and inspect consistency of conclusions.
- Export report and supporting analysis artifacts for manuscript submission.

### Table 2. Minimum input schema and validation checks
| Input field | Required | Validation rule | Failure risk if missing/invalid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Study identifier | Yes | Unique per row/group | Mislabelled outputs, merge errors |
| Effect/endpoint variables | Yes | Numeric + interpretable scale | Invalid model estimation |
| Uncertainty/count fields | Yes | Non-negative and non-null | Biased weighting or unstable inference |
| Model-setting metadata | Yes | Explicitly recorded at run time | Non-reproducible reruns |
| Source file provenance | Recommended | Track input path and version | Ambiguous audit trail |

### Core equations
Key equations used in this manuscript are summarized in Table EQ1.

### Equation summary table
| Eq. ID | Model component | Expression | Interpretation role |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Study-level odds ratio definition | `OR_i = \frac{a_i d_i}{b_i c_i}, \quad y_i = \ln(OR_i)` | Defines each study effect estimate before pooling under fixed- or random-effects assumptions. |
| E2 | Random-effects pooled estimator | `\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum_i w_i y_i}{\sum_i w_i}, \quad w_i = \frac{1}{v_i + \tau^2}` | Computes the pooled effect as a precision-weighted average under heterogeneity. |
| E3 | Heterogeneity proportion (IÂ²) | `I^2 = \max\left(0,\frac{Q-df}{Q}\right)\times 100\%` | Estimates the proportion of total variability attributable to between-study heterogeneity. |

### Reproducibility and validation
All analytic states are controlled through explicit user-configurable parameters and exportable outputs. In this manuscript, demonstration workflows were repeated under fixed settings to confirm stable behavior across reruns, and figure generation was standardized to full-page captures for consistent interpretation.

### Core functionality exposed in the interface
- Interactive data ingestion and validation controls
- Configurable analysis models with sensitivity options
- Integrated visualization panels for interpretive review
- Export pathways for reporting and reproducibility artifacts

### Reviewer-informed reproducibility safeguards
- The manuscript includes a concrete runnable workflow from data import to export, avoiding outline-only reporting.
- Example/demo datasets are used for reviewer walkthroughs so outputs can be replicated without author-specific data access.
- Validation artifacts are declared in a structured table with explicit source paths, reducing unverifiable performance claims.
- Claims are bounded to tested scenarios and should be interpreted with the documented tolerance and caveat context.

### Output interpretation guidance
Interpret outputs jointly across effect estimates, uncertainty intervals, heterogeneity diagnostics, and sensitivity results. For small study counts, rare-event settings, or model-mismatch scenarios, treat asymmetry tests and pooled estimates cautiously. When assumptions are only approximately met (e.g., large-sample approximations), results should be reported with explicit caveats.

### Table 4. Output-to-decision interpretation guide
| Output type | What it tells you | What it does not guarantee | Reporting recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary pooled/model estimate | Central tendency under stated assumptions | Universal validity across all settings | Report with assumptions and uncertainty |
| Heterogeneity metrics | Between-study variability signal | Definitive cause of heterogeneity | Pair with subgroup/sensitivity rationale |
| Bias/asymmetry checks | Potential small-study/publication-bias signal | Definitive proof of bias mechanism | Report small-k limitations explicitly |
| Sensitivity analyses | Robustness under alternate assumptions | Immunity to all model misspecification | Present scenario-wise evidence table |

## Use cases
### Demonstration dataset used for manuscript walkthrough
- Dataset profile: Demo pairwise dataset imported from RevMan/Covidence-compatible structure
- Rationale: a fixed demo dataset enables reproducible method demonstration and easier reviewer verification.

### Use case 1: Pairwise synthesis demonstration
Workflow:
- Import the demo dataset using the built-in import workflow.
- Run the default analysis and verify forest and contribution outputs.
- Capture summary outputs and export report artifacts.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Pairwise pooled effects with visual evidence summaries
- Report-ready output bundle

### Use case 2: Bias and HTA interpretation cycle
Workflow:
- Use the same dataset to review bias and HTA interpretation panels.
- Re-run with adjusted options if required by the review protocol.
- Record final interpretation statements with exported outputs.
Expected outputs for the manuscript:
- Integrated statistical and HTA narrative
- Transparent interpretation record

### Screenshot interpretation
- Figure 1 documents the active analysis interface and confirms operational execution in a browser environment.
- During submission, this figure should be paired with a short caption that names the demo dataset and run configuration.

### Reviewer-facing walkthrough (replicable package check)
1. Open the primary application file in `Truthcert1` and load an included demo/example dataset.
2. Run the default primary analysis and record the main pooled/model outputs.
3. Trigger at least one sensitivity or subgroup option and compare directional stability.
4. Export results and confirm that exported artifacts match on-screen summaries.
5. Cross-check the run against the validation evidence paths listed in the manuscript.

### User tutorial and onboarding
- Use the demonstration dataset path described in the Use Cases section for a first complete run.
- Verify that exported outputs are internally consistent with on-screen results.
- Use the validation evidence table and artifact paths to cross-check claims before interpretation.
- Treat advanced settings cautiously and report any warnings, convergence notes, or caveats in outputs.

### Table 5. Assumptions, diagnostics, and caution flags
| Component | Assumption | Recommended diagnostic | Caution flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| Effect model | Chosen form reflects study design and outcome scale | Residual pattern + sensitivity reruns | Large directional shifts across settings |
| Heterogeneity handling | Random-effects assumptions are plausible | Tau/I2/Q-related diagnostics | Small-k instability or extreme heterogeneity |
| Approximation regime | Large-sample approximations adequate for data context | Rare-event and small-k checks | Sparse events / unstable variance |
| Sensitivity module | Alternative settings should not reverse core interpretation without explanation | Structured scenario comparison table | Inference changes without transparent rationale |

## Discussion
The software provides a coherent end-to-end path from data input to interpretive outputs, improving reproducibility for routine pairwise analyses. Its validation documentation is a strength because it separates core agreement findings from advanced-estimator caveats.

The main limitation is that not all advanced estimator pathways are equally aligned in current artifacts, which should be stated explicitly in interpretation. This transparency is methodologically preferable and supports credible revision planning.

### Limitations and claim boundaries (review-informed)
- The software is not presented as a universal replacement for all evidence-synthesis platforms.
- Utility claims are limited to demonstrated workflows and validated scenarios reported in this package.
- Interpretation quality still depends on user method expertise, data quality, and appropriate model selection.
- Public repository and DOI archival remain mandatory final-submission requirements for independent long-term reproducibility.

## Conclusions
TruthCert PairwisePro supports transparent pairwise synthesis with clear validation boundaries and reproducible outputs. With final metadata completion, it remains suitable for software-method submission under evidence-calibrated claims.
