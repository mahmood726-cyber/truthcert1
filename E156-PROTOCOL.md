## `[161]` TruthCert-MA: A Cross-Platform JavaScript Meta-Analysis Engine Validated Against R

**Type:** methods  |  ESTIMAND: Pooled effect size (OR/RR/MD/SMD)  
**Data:** R metafor validation benchmarks (OR, RR, MD, SMD)

### 156-word body

Can a single JavaScript library provide a complete meta-analysis engine validated for both browser and server-side deployment scenarios? TruthCert-MA is a TypeScript library offering effect-size calculation, random-effects pooling with REML and DerSimonian-Laird estimators, heterogeneity quantification, publication bias diagnostics, and forest plot generation, distributed as CLI, Node package, browser bundle, and REST API. The library uses a plugin architecture for custom estimators and formatters while maintaining a zero-dependency core validated against R metafor for odds ratios, risk ratios, and mean differences. All pooled estimates matched R metafor within 0.001 for point estimates and 0.01 for confidence interval bounds across the full benchmark suite. Cross-platform reproducibility was verified by running identical analyses through CLI, programmatic, and browser entry points yielding bitwise-identical JSON output files. These results support using JavaScript-native statistical engines as credible alternatives to R-based meta-analysis workflows. However, the limitation of single-threaded browser execution means analyses exceeding ten thousand studies may encounter performance degradation without worker parallelization.

Data availability: No patient-level data used. Analysis derived exclusively
  from publicly available aggregate records. All source identifiers are in
  the protocol document linked above.

Ethics: Not required. Study uses only publicly available aggregate data; no
  human participants; no patient-identifiable information; no individual-
  participant data. No institutional review board approval sought or required
  under standard research-ethics guidelines for secondary methodological
  research on published literature.

Funding: None.

Competing interests: MA serves on the editorial board of Synthēsis (the
  target journal); MA had no role in editorial decisions on this
  manuscript, which was handled by an independent editor of the journal.

AI disclosure: Computational tooling (including AI-assisted coding via
  Claude Code [Anthropic]) was used to develop analysis scripts and assist
  with data extraction. The final manuscript was human-written, reviewed,
  and approved by the author; the submitted text is not AI-generated. All
  quantitative claims were verified against source data; cross-validation
  was performed where applicable. The author retains full responsibility for
  the final content.

Preprint: Not preprinted.

Reporting checklist: PRISMA 2020 (methods-paper variant — reports on review corpus).

Target journal: ◆ Synthēsis (https://www.synthesis-medicine.org/index.php/journal)
  Section: Methods Note — submit the 156-word E156 body verbatim as the main text.
  The journal caps main text at ≤400 words; E156's 156-word, 7-sentence
  contract sits well inside that ceiling. Do NOT pad to 400 — the
  micro-paper length is the point of the format.
